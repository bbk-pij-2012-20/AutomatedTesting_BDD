To generate the Selenium Java code, I started 'record' from the Selenium IDE, 
performed the login, kettle search, etc. 
Then selected to 'export test case as Java JUnit4 webdriver'.

The auto-generated Java code was then inserted into different 'scenarios'
in the Cucumber format. (In amazonKetle/src/test/java/com/bdd/amazonKettle).
