This was an exercises set by a company regarding web application automated testing.
The tools I used were Selenium, Cucumber and the Maven build tool. The task
was to test going to the Amazon uk website, logging in, inserting a search term (Kettle), 
selecting the 6th item, editting the shopping basket, adding the item to the shopping
basket. 
I was asked to write tests in BDD style. The code was written in Java. 
With no previous experience of automated webpage testing, Selenium, Cucumber, Maven or BDD,
I made a decent attempt though it does not compile.
