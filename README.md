I wrote this lot for a pre-interview exercise set by a company regarding web application automated testing.

The tools I used were Selenium, Cucumber and the Maven build tool. 
The task given was to test navigating to the Amazon uk website, logging in, inserting a search term (Kettle), 
selecting the 6th item, editting the shopping basket, adding the item to the shopping
basket. 

I was asked to write in BDD style. The code was written in Java. 

With no previous experience of automated webpage testing, Selenium, Cucumber, Maven or BDD,
I made a decent attempt at it though it does not compile.
